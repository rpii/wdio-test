# wdio-test

A test project for evaluating the webdriverio platform



## Configuration
To run the test you need to create a symlink in the config folder to what you are trying to run.
for now, mklink wdio.conf.js chrome.conf.js will show the issue in chrome.

Its working good now.  you can not use the selectors $() as mentioned in the web.  use a straight xpath or css selector liek what you would capture from chropath

Cheers!
